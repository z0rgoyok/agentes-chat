/**
 * What one agent's Chrome sends and receives (protocol 23), from its own
 * DevTools network events: one connection to its browser endpoint, attached
 * (flat sessions) to every page, frame and worker it opens, Chrome's own UI
 * left out and nothing paused, with network events on and no bodies kept for
 * us. Never the rest of the computer, never a URL or a header kept or logged.
 *
 * - Received: each finished response's encoded size (headers included); for
 *   one that failed, what had arrived; nothing for a response a service worker
 *   served (the worker's own fetch is counted on its target).
 * - Sent: each request's headers and its `Content-Length`.
 * - WebSocket frames: their payload (UTF-8 text, or binary).
 * - Not seen: a file Chrome saves as a download (only its request: its body
 *   reaches no network event).
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-27 on Chrome for Testing 155 against local servers: within
 * 0.2% of the bytes they sent and received (the headers). Chrome keeps no byte
 * count of its own to read instead: its histograms moved for neither way.
 *
 * The same connection says when a tab's page died (`Inspector.targetCrashed`
 * on its session: Chrome's sad tab) and opens it again or shows another page
 * there (`onCrash`), and asks Chrome to quit (`quit`), so each Chrome has one
 * socket of ours.
 *
 * It also holds the page size the agent asked for (`emulate`, protocol 52) on every tab,
 * and sends a person's pointer input to the active tab without waiting for Chrome.
 *
 * It also guards a password about to be typed (ADR 0144, `guard`): for a
 * while, every request of that Chrome pauses (`Fetch.enable` on each of its
 * sessions, new ones too) and one whose address carries the password fails
 * (`Fetch.failRequest`) instead of leaving; the rest go on at once. The guard
 * is ready once Chrome acknowledged `Fetch.enable` on every session it has
 * then (ones that attached since the last guard too), and the runner types only
 * then. An error in answer leaves that session unpaused, so the guard isn't
 * ready, unless the session is gone. Only while armed: nothing is paused
 * otherwise. A dedicated worker has no `Fetch` of its own ("'Fetch.enable' wasn't
 * found"), and what it requests pauses on its page's session (measured on Chrome
 * for Testing 155 and 157, nested workers too): it isn't asked. reCAPTCHA starts
 * one, so a sign-in page with it could never be guarded otherwise.
