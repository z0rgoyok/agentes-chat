/**
 * The agent browser (protocol 12, ADR 0040). The runner drives the pinned
 * `agent-browser` (a Rust CLI + daemon speaking CDP to a local Chrome), one
 * headless session per agent with a persistent profile in the agent's folder,
 * so a login done once stays. Agents never reach the CLI: the server sends
 * one command at a time (`browser.act`) and the runner adds the flags that
 * matter (session, profile, our empty config, output limits) and refuses the
 * ones that would widen what the browser reaches (another profile, CDP,
 * plugins, the vault, the dashboard, chat).
 *
 * - Binary: the desktop app's sidecar next to the runner, else the shared
 *   install's (`SYSTEM_BROWSER_DIR`, which `install.sh --system` fills and
 *   only root can change), else a download of the pinned release into
 *   `<runner home>/bin/`, checked against its SHA-256 before it is ever run.
 * - Chrome: Google Chrome stable, the computer's own install at its standard
 *   path (`findChrome`), never a copy of our own: it updates itself the normal
 *   way (Google's apt repository on Linux, Google's updater on macOS and
 *   Windows), with no version pinned. On Linux on ARM, where Google makes
 *   none, the distribution's Chromium (ADR 0153). Each agent has its own profile, so the
 *   person's own Chrome profile is never touched, and our Chrome never starts
 *   Google's updater itself (`--disable-updater-scheduler`: macOS blamed our
 *   app for it, "agentes was prevented from modifying apps"). A new version on
 *   disk restarts an agent's Chrome on the same page once it is idle (`sweep`).
 *   A Chrome that is missing or won't start is told to the agent in plain words
 *   (`CHROME_FAILURES`), and the server reports it. A runner outside system mode
 *   gets `agent-browser` as it starts, once the browser is on (`prepareInBackground`).
 * - Ready ahead (`warm`, ADR 0040 §11): the agent's Chrome starts before its
 *   first command, as that command would start it, and each command says what
 *   it waited on before it ran (`setup`).
 * - The runner starts that Chrome itself (headless, its own debugging port,
 *   the agent's profile) and every command connects to it (`--cdp`). A Chrome
 *   that `agent-browser` launches carries automation markers
 *   (`navigator.webdriver`, "HeadlessChrome"): measured on a Mac, Google's
 *   sign-in answered "this browser or app may not be secure" and its search
 *   sent the page to /sorry ("unusual traffic"), while the same Chrome started
 *   by the runner and attached reached the account check and the results.
 *   Sites' own rules still apply: a challenge goes to a person through the
 *   help request, never solved by the agent.
 * - Commands run one at a time per session (the daemon does too: a read waits
 *   behind the agent's command). A read never starts Chrome: it needs the
 *   session's Chrome running, and checks the page is reachable unless the
 *   last command just succeeded. Anything else starts Chrome when it isn't.
 * - The runner stops its Chromes itself: after the idle time (not while a
 *   person watches or a help request is open), on `stop`, and when it stops.
 *   A help request forgotten on a dropped server connection still holds for
 *   the idle time (the server says again on reconnect), and `agent-browser`'s
 *   own idle timeout is kept off meanwhile. A browser that closed anyway under
 *   an open help request opens again on its last page when a person views it.
 *   Their pids are kept in `<runner home>/browser/chromes.json`, so a runner
 *   that crashed closes what it left on its next start.
 * - The site allowlist is ours: `--allowed-domains` refuses persistent
 *   profiles, so navigations are checked before they go and the page after
 *   each action (top-level pages only; sub-resources aren't filtered).
 * - An agent's clicks and typing reach the page as a person's (`humanly`, `humanAtPoint`, `human-input.ts`): a pointer
 *   path, a held button, keys one by one. A person's own input (`relayCommands`) goes as they made it.
 * - Live view: the session's local stream (JPEG frames over a WebSocket) is
 *   relayed as `browser.frame` only while the server asked for it, with the
 *   active tab's address and title; a page that isn't repainting gets one
 *   screenshot as its first frame. A stream can't start on a closed browser
 *   (`browser_closed`): a command opens it first. Frames are JPEG at quality
 *   60, at most 1280 pixels wide or tall (a high-density screen's frame is
 *   scaled down to that); where they go is the runner's (`BrowserViews`,
 *   ADR 0040 §7.1). The stream sends one at a time (`pacing=ack`): the next
 *   once the live view has room for it (`frameRoom`, `room`).
 * - On the agent's desktop (ADR 0058 §7, a request's `desktop`): the same
 *   Chrome runs headed on that display, so people watching the desktop see it;
 *   the desktop starts first. A Chrome in the other mode moves at the next
 *   command that may start one (same profile, same page), never while someone
 *   watches it or a person's turn is open. While it is in use there, its
 *   desktop doesn't stop as idle; while its desktop is watched, it is in use.
 *   In system mode this runs in the agent's worker, as the agent's own user,
 *   on the desktop root starts for it (`WorkerLink.desktop`).
 * - Browser on the agent's desktop (`desktop-browser.ts`, `show`): a person's
 *   click brings that same Chrome there, started, moved or in front, and is
 *   answered once its window shows there.
 * - A page that dies (its renderer crashed or ran out of memory: Chrome's sad
 *   tab) is opened again at once, and the agent's next action is answered
 *   with what happened instead of running on a page that changed under it
 *   (looks and waits run, on the page as it is now). One that dies again
 *   before the agent heard of it shows our own notice there, once, never a
 *   reload loop (`pageCrashed`).
