/**
 * The Codex branch of `brain.turn` (ADR 0032, ADR 0029 "Codex"): one agent
 * turn as `codex exec --json`, its JSONL turned into brain events.
 * Protocol 15: where the runner has them, turns run on a long-lived
 * `codex app-server` instead (`brain-codex-app.ts`: the same events, plus
 * messages mid-turn); this file stays the fallback and shares its mapping.
 *
 * - First turn of a session: `codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C <cwd>
 *   --sandbox <workspace-write | read-only> -c developer_instructions=<system>
 *   <MCP bridge -c …> [-m <model>] -o <last.txt> -`, the prompt on stdin. Next
 *   turns: the same options without the instructions (the thread keeps them),
 *   then `resume <thread_id> -`.
 * - ADR 0053 §3: the turn's permission profile is its sandbox, never with the
 *   network: `plan` is read-only, `work` writes in its folders. `exec` can't
 *   ask for approvals (it forces approval_policy=never), so whatever the
 *   sandbox refuses stays refused; the app-server mode answers Codex's
 *   approvals with the command policy instead (`brain-codex-app.ts`). Nothing
 *   in the Codex home lifts the sandbox: its network and writable roots are
 *   ours, and no one's own rules apply (`--ignore-rules`; a turn where Codex
 *   would load some runs on exec, `codexRulesNear`).
 * - Codex picks its thread id (`thread.started`): our session id → that
 *   thread lives in `<runner home>/brain/codex-threads.json`. A runner that
 *   lost it starts a new thread (with the instructions again).
 * - Events: `agent_message` (exec has no deltas: the last completed one is
 *   the answer, sent whole as one `text_delta`, `last.txt` when the stream had
 *   none), `command_execution` / `file_change` (`tool_call` already executed,
 *   for the transcript), `turn.completed` usage (the plan's), `turn.failed`
 *   (the error; a usage limit is `limit` first). `error` events alone don't
 *   end a turn (Codex retries after some); exit code and `turn.failed` decide.
 *   Our MCP bridge's tool calls are not repeated: the engine ran them.
 * - The MCP bridge needs `default_tools_approval_mode="approve"` or every tool
 *   without `readOnlyHint` is denied. The token reaches the bridge through
 *   the env (`env_vars`, or `bearer_token_env_var` for an HTTP bridge), never argv.
 * - ADR 0041: a turn with an `account` runs with `CODEX_HOME` set to that
 *   account's folder (missing: `account_missing`, never another account); its
 *   threads are remembered per account. `effort` is `-c model_reasoning_effort`
 *   (`xhigh` and `max` are `high`).
 * - Windows (`codex-windows.ts`): the native `codex.exe`, started directly; a
 *   `plan` or `work` turn only where MXC holds its commands (else
 *   `windows_sandbox`), with it named in `-c` and nothing asked; a thread's
 *   instructions lead its first prompt on stdin, never the command line.
